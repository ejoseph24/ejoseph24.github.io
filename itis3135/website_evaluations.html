      <p>The website is for an insurance company (mostly advertising to potential customers about their services).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The background on most pages is a pleasent dark blue, and text is either a bright white or light turquiose, both of which stand out well on the background. Images, designs, and logos follow this minimalistic white color scheme and look sleek on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Every page has a similar motif of the dark blue background, and the transitions between pages are very smooth. It almost feels as if your using a very pretty slideshow. The design is unified from the background, text, and images.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All items are aligned mostly to the center and spaced out evenly amongst other elements. On pages like the "About", the text is aligned based off of the image. From the text to the elements, nothing feels inappropriately compressed or odd. Everything is easily readable.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Similar ideas (such as the Protected Cells) and their charts have appropriate proximity between each other. Navigation links are easy to find and in an easily locatable spot. Nothing feels out of place on the pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Overall Rating = 3.8/4: </strong> Sleek, minimalistic design. Everything on the pages has purpose, transitions are smooth, and locating pages is easy. The HTML code is clean, well organized, and maintainable. An excellent example of the design principles.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The website displays shipwrecks around Ireland.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The colors stand apart, but jarringly so. The map itself has neon yellow and bright green, the text is bright blue in some areas, and it overall does not ease the eyes or draw attention to important elements correctly. Subpages have a blue ocean image background and have bright blue test on top of it, still making it difficult to read.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The main page has a beige paper background, and this repeated in some pages. However, some pages such as the "Wreck Lists by County" hold a different motif and have inconsistencies within it. Pages do not look very similar or familiar.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Alignment varies drastically depending on the page. On some pages, aliment is achieves using tables for text, in others it's spaced out randomly. Nothing feels cohesive, interconnected, or organized.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The relationship of items is visible in some instances, but not others. While navigating the page, it's difficult to understand which items relate (specially since the spaces between sentences on some pages are achieved by large tables, leading to more confusion).</li>
        <li><strong>Overall Rating = 0.5/4: </strong>Not great in terms of design. Many pages don't look very good, the colors are not pleasent, spacing is not achieved well. Upon looking at the "View Page Source", the code is just as messy and disorganized as the website. However, the actual content of the website is good.</li>
