    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Excellent website!!! The page has a clean/minimalistic design, easy to read, and intuitive.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>The submission led to the correct page.</li>
      <li>All folder names use correct/conventional naming.</li>
      <li>Design:
        <ol>
          <li>The font style and size are very easy to read. The colors of the page are pleasant. </li>
          <li>The page does use a .css file for styling.</li>
          <li>CRAP Principles:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Elements stand out and draw users to certain pages. The beige boxes help draw the users eyes to key information, and the maroon buttons clearly display the different navigation elements.</li>
              <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> All pages maintain the same font style, header style, and shapes (such as for images or div boxes) for each page. Menu page is unfinished but a note was left there.</li>
              <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All items are aligned in a compact way onto the page, and it helps put more information onto the website without overwhelming the user. For example, the "About Us" section has a box for "Hours", "Location", and an "FAQ".</li>
              <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements are grouped and spaced out compactly, wasting no space on the page. I would recommend restructturing the homepage a bit since the "About Chopbox" section is at the bottom when it might be better served at the top for new customers.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Page has within it:
        <ol>
          <li>Header: The header for each page looks great.</li>
          <li>Main: From what I saw in the code for each page, every page has a main.</li>
          <li>Footer: All pages have a minimalistic footer that blends in with the rest of the page, although I believe the project requirements state that you need to link your personal design firm in the footer.</li>
          <li>Nav Bar: The nav bar is clear to find and intuitive to use. I like how effects are utilized to make it lightly glow when hovered. Clicking on the Chopbox logo sends the user back to "Home", which is also a great addition.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Header does have the site/brand header with the text in an h1. The logo looks great, I'd recommend setting it as a favicon as well.</li>
      <li>The main does start with the name of the page as an h2 on every page.</li>
      <li>Footer:
        <ol>
          <li>The footer is clean and minimalistic, clearly separate from the rest of the page.</li>
          <li>No HTML or CSS validation links present.</li>
          <li>According to the assignment requirements though, it might need your design firm linked.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Personal Recommendations:</strong> As previously mentioned in the review, here are some suggestions I would give before you submit your final project:
        <ul>
          <li>Include more examples of JS functionality. At the time of this review, I did not see anything in the "Menu" tab.</li>
          <li>Maybe look into moving the boxes around on the "Home" page. The "About Chopbox" might want to be at the top for new customers.</li>
          <li>Remember to link your HTML/CSS validators in the footer. I think it was a requirement in the project.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
