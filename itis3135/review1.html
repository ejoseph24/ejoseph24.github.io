      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Excellent website!!! The page has a clean/minimalistic design, easy to read, and intuitive.</p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The submission led to the correct page.</li>
        <li>All folder names use correct/conventional naming.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>The font style and size are very easy to read. The colors of the page are pleasant.</li>
            <li>The page does use a .css file for styling.</li>
            <li><strong>CRAP Principles:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Elements stand out and draw users to certain pages. The beige boxes help draw the user's eyes to key information, and the maroon buttons clearly display the different navigation elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> All pages maintain the same font style, header style, and shapes (such as for images or div boxes) for each page. Menu page is unfinished but a note was left there.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All items are aligned in a compact way onto the page, and it helps put more information onto the website without overwhelming the user. For example, the "About Us" section has a box for "Hours", "Location", and an "FAQ".</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements are grouped and spaced out compactly, wasting no space on the page. I would recommend restructuring the homepage a bit since the "About Chopbox" section is at the bottom when it might be better served at the top for new customers.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Page has within it:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Header: The header for each page looks great.</li>
            <li>Main: From what I saw in the code for each page, every page has a main.</li>
            <li>Footer: All pages have a minimalistic footer that blends in with the rest of the page, although I believe the project requirements state that you need to link your personal design firm in the footer.</li>
            <li>Nav Bar: The nav bar is clear to find and intuitive to use. I like how effects are utilized to make it lightly glow when hovered. Clicking on the Chopbox logo sends the user back to "Home", which is also a great addition.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The header does have the site/brand header with the text in an h1. The logo looks great, I'd recommend setting it as a favicon as well.</li>
        <li>The main does start with the name of the page as an h2 on every page.</li>
        <li><strong>Footer:</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>The footer is clean and minimalistic, clearly separate from the rest of the page.</li>
            <li>No HTML or CSS validation links present.</li>
            <li>According to the assignment requirements though, it might need your design firm linked.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Personal Recommendations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Include more examples of JS functionality. At the time of this review, I did not see anything in the "Menu" tab.</li>
        <li>Maybe look into moving the boxes around on the "Home" page. The "About Chopbox" might want to be at the top for new customers.</li>
        <li>Remember to link your HTML/CSS validators in the footer. I think it was a requirement in the project.</li>
      </ul>
