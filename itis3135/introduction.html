    <ul>
        <li><b>Personal background:</b>  I was born in the north of the USA, but grew up in Raleigh (NC).</li>
        <li><b>Professional background:</b> Participated in youth cybersecurity competitions for a few years, then served as an assistant mentor to help teach other high-schoolers about OS security and other cyber-related topics (Windows, Ubuntu, Cisco Packet Tracer).</li>
        <li><b>Academic background:</b>  I did dual-enrollment in high-school and saved myself some time on courses in college through transfer credits. I earned two cyber certifications, one in high-school and one last semester. I'm currently a Computer Science major with a concentration in Cybersecurity.</li>
        <li><b>Background in this subject:</b>  I have experience in Python and Java. My knowledge of SQL and HTML mostly comes from understanding its vulnerabilities in the cyber landscape.</li>
        <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b>  Windows 10 laptop (I will resist Windows 11 until Microsoft forces me to).</li>
        <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b> <ul>
            <li><b>ITSC 3155 Software Engineering</b> -  Required for my major and because I'm very interested in working with a team to develop an application that solves some problem. I'm looking forward to learning how software is created, implemented, and maintained.</li>
            <li><b>ITIS 3135 Web-Based Application Design and Development</b> -  Required for my major and because web-design seems fun.</li>
            <li><b>ITSC 3146 Introduction to Operating Systems and Networking</b> -  Required for my major, and I'm interested in learning more about networking systems and how they function.</li>
            <li><b>STAT 2122 Introduction to Probability and Statistics</b> -  Required for my major and I enjoy a bit of math.</li>
            <li><b>ITIS 3200 Introduction to Information Security and Privacy</b> -  Required for my major. I've learned much of this course's material from the CompTIA Security+ certification, but I look forward to hearing the practical wisdom from an excellent instructor.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</b> I earned a pilot's license when I was 18 years old. Hopefully one day I'll be able to traverse the land, air, and sea if I get a boating license.</li>
