  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Excellent page showcasing Dylan's tutoring services and expertise! The page looks professional but not bland, and was intuitive to navigate. Everything was organized effectively, so it was easy to read up on the work and research Dylan has done.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>The submission led to the correct page.</li>
    <li>All folder names use correct/conventional naming.</li>
    <li>Design:
        <ol>
            <li>The font style and size are fairly easy to read. The font style and contrast is great, but it might be best to find a bolder version of the font because sometimes it only appears 2-3 pixels wide, making it a bit difficult to read.</li>
            <li>The page does use a .css file for styling.</li>
            <li>CRAP Principles:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Elements stand out and draw users to certain pages. I like how the "Testimonials" button in the header is a muted pink (drawing the user to see the people Dylan has helped). I would recommend maybe finding a brighter version of these colors though, as these more muted colors might make the site a bit faded.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> All pages maintain the same font style, header style, and shapes (such as for images or div boxes) for each page.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All items are center aligned and look naturally placed on the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements are grouped and spaced out well, especially on pages such as "Tutoring Services" and "Contact Dylan". The flex gallery looks great, and I like the interactivity of the images getting larger when hovered</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Page has within it:
        <ol>
            <li>Header: The header for each page looks great.</li>
            <li>Main: From what I saw in the code for each page, every page has a main.</li>
            <li>Footer: All pages have a minimalistic footer that blends in with the rest of the page (though the link for "Kialey Digital Solutions" gives a 404 error).</li>
            <li>Nav Bar: The nav bar is clear to find and intuitive to use.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Header does have the site/brand header with the text in an h1. I don't see a logo, but since this is a tutoring service it's not nessecary.</li>
    <li>The main does start with the name of the page as an h2 on almost every page.</li>
    <li>Footer:
        <ol>
            <li>The footer is clean and minimalistic. If you'd like, you could link Dylan's professional/business socials at the end and include the respective logos for that (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.)</li>
            <li>No HTML or CSS validation links present.</li>
            <li>The link to the "Kialey Digital Solutions" does not work.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Personal Recommendations:</strong> As previously mentioned in the review, here are some suggestions I would give before you submit your final project (though it looks very close to being complete).
        <ul>
            <li>Perhaps edit the colors to a brighter equivalent. Right now, it seems a bit dull in color, but a quick change on the brightness will make it pop out more.</li>
            <li>It might be helpful for Contrast to pick a bolder version of your current font. Most of the paragraph text appears only 2-3 pixels wide on conventional laptop screens, leading to readability issues.</li>
            <li>Remember to link your HTML/CSS validators in the footer. I think it was a requirement in the project.</li>
            <li>When the contact form is submitted, a 404 error showed up. Since the form doesen't have to actually collect respnses, just make sure the submission is void once a user hits "Submit".</li>
            <li>The link to your Digital Solutions page does not work at the moment, so it might just need to be correctly linked.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
