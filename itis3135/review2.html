      <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Excellent page showcasing Dylan's tutoring services and expertise! The page looks professional but not bland, and was intuitive to navigate. Everything was organized effectively, so it was easy to read up on the work and research Dylan has done.</p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The submission led to the correct page.</li>
        <li>All folder names use correct/conventional naming.</li>
        <li><strong>Design:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The font style and size are fairly easy to read. The font style and contrast are great, but it might be best to find a bolder version of the font because sometimes it only appears 2-3 pixels wide, making it a bit difficult to read.</li>
            <li>The page does use a .css file for styling.</li>
            <li><strong>CRAP Principles:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Elements stand out and draw users to certain pages. I like how the "Testimonials" button in the header is a muted pink (drawing the user to see the people Dylan has helped). I would recommend maybe finding a brighter version of these colors though, as these more muted colors might make the site a bit faded.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> All pages maintain the same font style, header style, and shapes (such as for images or div boxes) for each page.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> All items are center-aligned and look naturally placed on the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Elements are grouped and spaced out well, especially on pages such as "Tutoring Services" and "Contact Dylan". The flex gallery looks great, and I like the interactivity of the images getting larger when hovered.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The header for each page looks great.</li>
        <li>Every page has a main section based on what I saw in the code.</li>
        <li>The footer is minimalistic and blends in with the rest of the page, though the link for "Kialey Digital Solutions" gives a 404 error.</li>
        <li>The nav bar is clear to find and intuitive to use.</li>
        <li>The header contains the site/brand header in an h1 tag. While there's no logo, it's not necessary for a tutoring service.</li>
        <li>Each page starts with the page name in an h2 tag.</li>
        <li>Footer: The footer is clean and minimalistic. You could link Dylan's professional/business socials at the end and include the respective logos for those (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.).</li>
        <li>No HTML or CSS validation links are present.</li>
        <li>The link to "Kialey Digital Solutions" does not work.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Personal Recommendations</h3>
      <p>As previously mentioned in the review, here are some suggestions I would give before you submit your final project (though it looks very close to being complete):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider editing the colors to a brighter equivalent. Right now, it seems a bit dull in color, but a quick change on the brightness will make it pop out more.</li>
        <li>It might be helpful for contrast to pick a bolder version of your current font. Most of the paragraph text appears only 2-3 pixels wide on conventional laptop screens, leading to readability issues.</li>
        <li>Remember to link your HTML/CSS validators in the footer, as I believe it was a project requirement.</li>
        <li>When the contact form is submitted, a 404 error showed up. Since the form doesn't need to collect responses, just make sure the submission is void once a user hits "Submit".</li>
        <li>The link to your Digital Solutions page does not work at the moment, so it might just need to be corrected.</li>
      </ul>
